This repo contains two codebases: [web](https://bitbucket.org/weatherworks/fullstack-challenge/src/master/web) contains a React app that is powered by a REST API in the   [api](https://bitbucket.org/weatherworks/fullstack-challenge/src/master/api) directory. The API uses [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) to talk to a SQLite database.

## Setup
1. Install Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install yarn: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable
3. Install deps by running `yarn deps`
4. Start the app with `yarn start`

## Tech stack

1. Front End
 - React, TypeScript, Chakra UI, axios
2. Back End
 - Node.js, Express, knex.js, SQLite

**PS**: I completed this project based on the requirements so I didn't use Redux or Redux ToolKit(RTK) for managing the state in this project but if I have more time and if you want to see my Redux skills, I can jump in starting the project with Redux as soon as possible.

And while I work on this project, I can see how wonderful strategies you have to grow your company and your team.
I also agree with your database choose because SQLite is very powerful and useful database to manage the big data like yours.

Thanks.


If all went well, you should be able to access the app at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
